1. How to take DSA Notes?
->Inputs and Outputs
->Edge Cases and corner cases
->Approach to solve the question
->Logic - formula, Diagram, Pseudo Code, Special Note eg- 2 Pointer,Greedy algo
->code - function with logic
->Time complexity
->dry run

2. How to approach DSA questions?
Step-1 :  Understand the problem.
Step-2 :  Devise a strategy
->Write logic in paper.

1. Brute Force Solution
->Plan to solve question using brute force approach.
2. Efficient Solution
->Find out efficent method to solve this question.
->If efficient method is know try to write on paper.
4. Constraints - See that which algo works to solve the question by seeing the constraints
5. Edge Cases and Conrner cases

Step-3: Break down the problem if possible
Step-4: Write pseudo code and dry run the code(try to dry run edge cases /Corner cases)
Step-5: Implement the solution
->convert psedo code to code(C++, Java, Python)
Step-6: testing and debugging - Logical Mistake, Syntax Error, Spelling Mistake, Debugging, handling edge cases.
Step-7: Optimize and review
